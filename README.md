# Reservation Web Application Project
A mini project on revervation web application using springboot and java.

# PROJECT PROPOSAL
PROBLEM STATEMNET WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED SOLUTION:
With the proposed solution in this repository, I would have to create new availabilities for people to make a reservation which will be time-consuming. 
I may end up forgetting to create a new availability even if I am available.The paradigm of AI and ML has contributed to making systems efficient and effective, improving human error and risk-taking, digital assistance, and faster decision making. If coded well, the AI and ML systems will have low error rate than humans.

## OBJECTIVE:
To design and implement a machine learning model to classify a given reservation to "yes I am Available" and "No I am not Available".

## SIGNIFICANCE OF USING ML MODEL:
To help prevent the creation of new availabilities every time.
To give the client the automotive view in creating a reservation
To have an automated system and improve accuracy in making reservations

## PROPOSED SOLUTION:
The proposed solution is to create an ML model to classify a given reservation into "Yes"  and "No" which means I am available, and I am not available. For a given reservation, my ML model will perform the classification and further decisions will be made from the labeled data(Target Variable).
When an individual or an organization, say "Giskard want to book my availability, the pre-trained Machine learning model will have you know if I am available or not.
